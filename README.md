# rock-paper-scissors

The player selects one of the three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

The computer randomly selects one of the three options (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).

The game then compares the player’s choice with the computer’s choice.

The comparison follows these rules:
- Rock beats Scissors
- Scissors beats Paper
- Paper beats Rock

If both the player and the computer choose the same option, the result is a tie.
